This repository contains the test application and raw measurement data used in the article "Comparative Study of Kubernetes Ingress Controllers After Ingress NGINX" ("Сравнительное исследование Ingress-контроллеров Kubernetes после ухода Ingress NGINX").

The goal of this repository is to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the load testing results.

## What Is Inside

The repository contains:
